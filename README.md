# Mini Message Board

Description: This project is a simple message board built with Express.js and EJS, designed to display messages from users and allow new messages to be added via a form. The application uses basic server-side rendering, routing, and form handling in Express.

Features:
Message Display: The main page displays all messages, showing the text, user, and timestamp.
Add New Messages: A form allows users to add new messages with their name and message text, which are then displayed on the main page.
Message Details: Each message can be opened to view detailed information, including the full text and the exact date and time it was added.
Routing: Includes routes for viewing all messages ("/"), adding a new message ("/new"), and viewing individual message details ("/msg/:index").
